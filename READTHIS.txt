KNOWN ISSUES:

overlap checker 2 still not working 100% -> idk how
as a result of that, the validSchedules created are not all valid

there seems to be an issue with the ranking system as well

the final result given back has duplicates, even though that shouldn't be possible

any class that starts / ends at #:05 has the minutes value stored as just 5, not 05
Reason for that is because when we cast the string of "05" to int, thats just mf "5", doesnt need the 0
how to fix? -> store as strings and only cast to int when needed to make the numerical comparison

TODO \ CUSCHEDULING 2.0 IDEAS:
-optimization of the backend...  (possible conversion to java?)
	-recursion to create the schedules? -> semi recursive approach discussed with vivek
	-update / change the classes we used (eg lecture/schedule)
		-schedule object redo:
			-should have built in behaviour for checking if the current schedule is valid
			-should have methods to add/remove lectures 
			-should have method for getting the restrictions/preferences associated with the schedule
			-should be able to reset the schedule
			
	-the only problem atm is that i cant get the code i wrote to run in the cuhacking folder, idk it works fine if u copy paste to another place or just
	run and compile the files from terminal. vscode sux maybe?


-atm our version does not take into account the availability of the classes... highkey sounds like an important feature to add.
-the info we need is already on the page that we scrape?????? why didnt we do this b4. just have to check the 'status' field in the table
 and make sure its set to open





-dont parse every single time its ran, rather run it once per (day? month? year?) and save data to database (SQL?)****** seems like a fantastic idea.


-even better UI/UX (tobys suggestion of automatically scrolling down to show the results for ex) (tho its still totally awesome, no hate towards you my love)
